## ðŸ”— The Graph Protocol Integration

### ðŸ“ˆ **The Graph Subgraph**

- **Folder**: [`nooroofi-subgraphs`](https://github.com/ShaunLim08/nooroofi-subgraphs)
- **Primary Endpoint**: `https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/subgraphs/id/6c58N5U4MtQE2Y8njfVrrAfRykzfqajMGeTMEvMmskVz`
- **Alternative Endpoint**: `https://api.goldsky.com/api/public/project_cl6mb8i9h0003e201j6li0diw/subgraphs/orderbook-subgraph/0.0.1/gn`
- **Purpose**: Queries on-chain Polymarket data including user positions, trading activity, and market events
- **Location in code**:
  - [`src/services/NewestMarketsFixed.js`](src/services/NewestMarketsFixed.js) - Main market data service
  - [`src/services/TrendingMarketData.js`](src/services/TrendingMarketData.js) - Trending market analysis
- **Key Queries**:
  ```graphql
  userPositions(orderBy: realizedPnl, orderDirection: desc)
  conditionPreparations(orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc)
  ```

### ðŸŒŠ **The Graph Substream**

- **Folder**: [`nooroofi-substream`](https://github.com/ShaunLim08/nooroofi-substream)
- **Purpose**: Real-time streaming of Polymarket events for live updates
- **Features**:
  - Live market creation notifications
  - Real-time trading activity feeds
  - Event-driven market updates
- **Integration**: Processes blockchain events in real-time to feed the subgraph with the latest data

### ðŸ”Œ **The Graph Token API**

- **Implementation**: Direct token ID queries to Polymarket's REST API
- **Data Flow**: Token IDs extracted from subgraph queries â†’ Used to fetch detailed market data via `/api/polymarket` proxy endpoint
- **Location**: ([app/profile/page.js](https://github.com/ShaunLim08/nooroofi-devmatch/blob/main/src/app/profile/page.js) - CORS proxy for Polymarket API calls

## ðŸ“¦ Smart Contract Integration

### ðŸ”— **Smart Contracts Repository**

- **Folder**: [`nooroofi-contracts`](https://github.com/ShaunLim08/nooroofi-contracts)
- **Deployed Sepolia Contract**: [`0x81dc5f9ce084ad3d3e0feb4f3f1956463eeaf12c`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x81dc5f9ce084ad3d3e0feb4f3f1956463eeaf12c)
- **Network**: Sepolia Testnet
- **Purpose**: Smart contracts for enhanced prediction market functionality
- **Integration**: Contract interactions handled through subgraph queries and direct blockchain calls
